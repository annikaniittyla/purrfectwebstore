# Purrfect Webstore

This repository contains a webstore for a pet shop. The webstore have several items which has been linked to categories. A user can search items with a key word or a product code and add them to shopping cart. An admin can add new products and categories through forms and also update or delete them. Checkout functions have not been included in the project.

## Purpose of the project
In this project, I wanted to learn to use Django framework with MySQL database. After attending the course called User Interface Construction in Aalto University, I saw this as an opportunity to put my knowledge into practise and design a website I'd like to use by myself. All of this led me also to get excited about studying HTML and CSS languages.

## Technology:
- Python
- Django
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Ajax (implementation is not ready yet)

## Structure of the website
The main page contains product categories from which a user can choose one he/she is interested in. Through a navigation bar, a user can search a specific product or as an admin, add new items and categories to store. Every item has an own page that contains product code, description, an image and information if the product is available in a storage. 

On the product page, a user can add an item to the shopping cart. A user can access to the shopping cart page through the navigation bar, an on the page he/she can see all the products that have been added as well the total price. On the shopping cart, a user can choose to go back to the store or continue to checkout.


## Improvements
- The form for adding products need fixes what comes to choosing a category for a new product.
- Shopping cart functions by using Ajax should be finished.
- Design of web pages is not finished. On the main page, I'd like to move categories to the left and leave the middle section for welcoming texts and offers. Additionally, I'd like to add a cover photo to the top of the page. The main thing is to pay attention to usability and user experience.
- User authentication functions for an admin should be added.
- More products and categories should be added.
